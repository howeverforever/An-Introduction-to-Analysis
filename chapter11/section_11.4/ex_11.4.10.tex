% === Exercise 11.4.10 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
Since $f(I) \subseteq \partial B_r(0)$, we know
$$
\| f(t) \|^2 = r^2
$$
for all $t\in I$.

Then for all $t\in I$, consider
$$
f(t)\cdot f(t) = \| f(t) \|^2 = r^2.
$$
Differentiating both sides in $t$, we have
$$
2 f(t)\cdot f'(t) = 0
$$
which implies
$$
f(t)\cdot f'(t) = 0.
$$
Hence, we conclude $f(t)$ is orthogonal to $f'(t)$ for all $t\in I$.
\end{proof}
