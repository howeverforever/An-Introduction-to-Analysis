\begin{Exercise}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item
\begin{proof}
Let
$$
F(x,y,z) = x y z-\sin(x+y+z).
$$
Then
$$
F_z(x,y,z) = x y - \cos(x+y+z).
$$
Therefore
$$
F(0,0,0) = 0\text{ and }F_z(0,0,0) = 1 \neq 0.
$$
By the Implicit Function Theorem, we know there is a nonempty, open set $V\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ containing $(0,0,0)$ and a unique continuously differentiable function
$g$ such that $z = g(0,0)$. So the solution is differentiable near $(0,0)$.
\end{proof}

\item
\begin{proof}
Let
$$
F(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2+z^2+\sqrt{\sin(x^2+y^2)+3z+4}-2.
$$
Then
$$
F_z(x,y,z) = 2z+\frac{3}{2\sqrt{\sin(x^2+y^2)+3z+4}}.
$$
Therefore
$$
F(0,0,0) = 0\text{ and }F_z(0,0,0) = \frac{4}{3} \neq 0.
$$
By the Implicit Function Theorem, we know there is a nonempty, open set $V\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ containing $(0,0,0)$ and a unique continuously differentiable function
$g$ such that $z = g(0,0)$. So the solution is differentiable near $(0,0)$.
