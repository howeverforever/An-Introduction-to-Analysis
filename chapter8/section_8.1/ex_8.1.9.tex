% === Exercise 8.1.9 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
Since $|a_k|, |b_k| \geq 0$, by the Arithmetic-Geometric mean Inequality, we consider
$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |a_k b_k|
\leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_k^2+b_k^2}{2}
= \frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k^2 \right).$$
Since the rightest hand converges by hypotheses. Moreover, by the Comparison Test, we conclude $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_k b_k$$ converges absolutely.
\end{proof}
