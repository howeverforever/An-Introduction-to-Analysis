% === Exercise 10.1.7 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
Pick $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$. There exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that 
$$
m,n\geq N \implies \rho(x_n,x_m)<\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}.
$$
By definition of discrete space, $x_n = x_m$ for all $n,m\geq N$. Hence for all $k\geq N$, we have $x_k=a\in\mathbb{R}$. This proves every $\{x_n\}$ converges to $a$ as $n\to\infty$. We conclude the discrete space is complete.
\end{proof}
