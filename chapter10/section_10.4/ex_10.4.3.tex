% === Exercise 10.4.3 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
Since $E$ is compact, then $E$ is bounded and closed. Since $E$ is bounded and nonempty, then $\sup E$ and $\inf E$ exist. There exists a sequence $x_n$ such that $x_n\to \sup E$ as $n\to\infty$. Since $E$ is closed, then
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = \sup E \in E.
$$
A similar argument proves that $\inf E\in E$.
