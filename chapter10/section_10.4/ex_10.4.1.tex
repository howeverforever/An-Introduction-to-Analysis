\begin{Exercise}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item
\begin{solution}
$E$ is bounded by $1$ obviously. Every subsequence of $E$ converges to $0\in E$, so $E$ is closed. Since this is Euclidean space, then we conclude $E$ is $\mathbf{compact}$.
\end{solution}

\item 
\begin{solution}
Sketch the graph. So we know $E$ is bounded by $b$ and closed. Since the space is $\mathbb{R}^2$, we conclude $E$ is $\mathbf{compact}$.
\end{solution}

\item
\begin{solution}
Set $(x_n, y_n) = \left(\frac{1}{2n\pi}, \sin(2n\pi)\right)$. Then
$$
(x_n,y_n)\to (0,0)\notin E\text{ as }n\to\infty.
$$
Regardless of the boundedness, it is not closed. Hence $E$ is $\mathbf{not\ compact}$.

We can find $H = E\cup\left\{(0,y):-1\leq y \leq 1\right\}$ which is compact.
\end{solution}

\item
\begin{solution}
$E$ is not bounded, so is $\mathbf{not\ compact}$. Moreover, we can not find $H$ as well.
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
