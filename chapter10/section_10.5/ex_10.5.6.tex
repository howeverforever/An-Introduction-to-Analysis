% === Exercise 10.5.6 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
Since $X$ is compact, there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ and points $x_k\in X$ for all $k\in\{1,2,\cdots,N\}$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:compact.6}
\bigcup_{k=1}^{N} B_{x_k} = X.
\end{equation}

Suppose to contrary that $f$ is not constant on $X$. W.L.O.G, we pick $a\in Y$, and assume $f(x_1) \neq a$ but $f(x_2) = f(x_3) = \cdots = f(x_N) = a$.
Since $f(x_1) \neq f(x_j)$ for all $j\in\{2,3,\cdots,N\}$. Consider
$$
B_{x_1}\cap \left( \bigcup_{j=2}^{N} B_{x_j} \right) = \emptyset.
$$

Let $U := B_{x_1}$ and $V := \bigcup_{j=2}^{N} B_{x_j}$. We know both $U$ and $V$ are nonempty and open in $X$. Also, $U\cap V=\emptyset$, and $U\cup V = X$ by \eqref{eq:compact.6}. This implies $X$ is not connected which is a contradiction to $X$ is connected by hypothesis.

Hence, we conclude $f$ is constant on $X$.
\end{proof}
