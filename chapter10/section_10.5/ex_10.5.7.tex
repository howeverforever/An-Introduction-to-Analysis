% === Exercise 10.5.7 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
$(\Longrightarrow)$

By Exercise 10.3.8, we know for each $\{E_{\alpha}\}$, there is a open set $F_{\alpha}$ in $X$ such that
$$
E_{\alpha} = F_{\alpha}\cap H.
$$
Notice that $\{F_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in A}$ is an open covering of $H$.
Since $H$ is compact, there exists finite subset $A_0$ of $A$ such that
$$
H \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha\in A_0} F_{\alpha}.
$$
Hence,
$$
H 
\subseteq H\cap\bigcup_{\alpha\in A_0} F_{\alpha}
= \bigcup_{\alpha\in A_0} F_{\alpha} \cap H
= \bigcup_{\alpha\in A_0} E_{\alpha}.
$$
which means $H$ has a finite subcover $\{E_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in A_0}$.

$(\Longleftarrow)$
Let $\{F_{\beta}\}_{\beta\in B}$ be an open covering of $H$, Then
$$
H \subseteq \bigcup_{\beta\in B} F_{\beta}.
$$
Hence,
$$
H
\subseteq H\cap\bigcup_{\beta\in B}F_{\beta} 
= \bigcup_{\beta\in B}F_{\beta} \cap H
$$
which implies $F_{\beta} \cap H$ is an open covering of $H$. Since $F_{\beta} \cap H$ are relatively open in $X$ for all $\beta\in B$, by hypothesis, we know there is a subset $B_0$ of $B$ such that
$$
H
\subseteq \bigcup_{\beta\in B_0}F_{\beta} \cap H
\subseteq \bigcup_{\beta\in B_0}F_{\beta}.
$$
This conclude every cover of $H$ has a finite subcover, which means $H$ is compact.
