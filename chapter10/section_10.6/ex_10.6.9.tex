% === Exercise 10.6.9 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
Suppose to contrary that $X$ has most countably many points. 

Since $f$ is continuous, then $f(X)$ also has most countably many points. Also $f$ is not constant, i.e., $f(X)$ has at least two points. Since $X$ is connected and $f$ is continuous, then $f(X)$ is connected on $\mathbb{R}$. 

Now we know $f(X)$ is one of following forms,
$$
(a,b)\text{ or }[a,b)\text{ or }(a,b]\text{ or } [a,b]
$$
where $a<b$ and $a,b$ are extended real numbers.
However all of these forms have uncountably many points which is a contradiction to the supposition.

We conclude $X$ has uncountably many points.
\end{proof}
