% === Exercise 10.6.5 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
Since $E$ is connected and $f:E\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $f(E)$ is connected. Since $f(a) \neq f(b) $, W.L.O.G., we assume $f(a) < f(b)$. 

Suppose to contrary that for all $x\in E$, there is a number $y\in\left(f(a), f(b)\right)$ such that $f(x) \neq y$. Then $(f(a), y)\cup(y,f(b)) \subset f(E)$ is not connected which is a contradiction to that $f(E)$ is connected.

Therefore, there is an $x\in E$ such that $f(x) = y$.
