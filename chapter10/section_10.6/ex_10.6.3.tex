\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
$(\Longrightarrow)$

For any closed set $C$ in $Y$, $C^c$ is open. By Theorem 10.58, $f^{-1}(C^c) = \left( f^{-1}(C) \right)^c$ is open, so $f^{-1}(C)$ is closed. Since $C$ is arbitrary, we have $f^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $Y$ for every closed $C$ in $Y$.

$(\Longleftarrow)$

Let $V$ be an open set in $Y$, then $V^c$ is closed. By hypothesis, $f^{-1}(V^c) = \left(f^{-1}(V)\right)^c$ is closed in $X$. Hence $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$. Since $V$ is arbitrary, we have $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$ for every open $V$ in $Y$. By Theorem 10.58, $f$ is continuous.
